When compiling chainlink_dtmfdet.c using g++, it failed with:

g++ -DPJ_AUTOCONF=1 -O2 -I/usr/local/src/svn/pjproject/pjlib/include -I/usr/local/src/svn/pjproject/pjlib-util/include -I/usr/local/

Using gcc, I was able to compile it, but this will cause problems with linking to sip-tester (which is compiled using g++) due to name mangling. So, to resolve the above problem I added the definitions before the call to include spandsp.h:

#define INT16_MAX 0x7fff
#define INT16_MIN (-INT16_MAX - 1) 
#include <spandsp.h>
