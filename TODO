TODO: 

1) update code that creates/starts/stops/destroy media streams: DONE.

1a) must review code that generates response call->media and response SDP: for each media offered we need to provide a m= line in the same order as the offered but the ones that were refused must have port set to zero. Also we might need to reorder elements from the media in the call_response json (but basically we need to remove medias from a response bag as the offer is processed).

2) if 'media: []' or 'media: null' it means there is no media, so do not generate a body (content-length: 0)

3) create a sample script with automatic reply for INFO, OPTIONS etc.

4) review processing of SUBSCRIBE (SUBSCRIBE is a dialog-creating method, so we should be able to keep the subscription object and be able to send requests (INFO) for it.

5) set proper call to PJW_LOCK/PJW_UNLOCK in on_dtmf and on_inband_dtmf

6) if digit buffers have no more space generate an error for the channel so that it doesn't get unnoticed.

7) on_media_update: when doing "Processing call->media", I forgot that we need to rearrange the array to remove blank spots in the middle of it (it is not enough to remove elements)
