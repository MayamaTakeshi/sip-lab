TODO: 

1) update code that creates/starts/stops/destroy media streams

2) if 'media: []' or 'media: null' it means there is no media, so do not generate a body (content-length: 0)

3) create a sample script with automatic reply for INFO, OPTIONS etc.

4) review processing of SUBSCRIBE (SUBSCRIBE is a dialog-creating method, so we should be able to keep the subscription object and be able to send requests (INFO) for it.

5) set proper call to PJW_LOCK/PJW_UNLOCK in on_dtmf and on_inband_dtmf

6) if digit buffers have no more space generate an error for the channel so that it doesn't get unnoticed.

7) on_media_update: when doing "Processing call->media", I forgot that we need to rearrange the array to remove blank spots in the middle of it (it is not enough to remove elements)
