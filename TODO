TODO: 

-------------------------
Prepare new

struct Request {
  inv;
  is_uac;
}

This will keep pending out-of-dialog requests (like REGISTER, OPTIONS, MESSAGE) that can be answered individually (407, 200, etc) by request_id:

-------------------------
need to allow hold parameter to each media independently (if parameter hold is absent on a media, the value of the parameter hold in the json options will be used (default is false).

-------------------------
we need to clone the active local/remote media for each MediaEndpoint of type audio/video using inv->pool_prov.
Then when on_media_update happens, we should compare them with the new active local/remote media and if they differ, we should restart the media endpoint.

-------------------------
the scripts samples/mrcp_and_audio.js and samples/mrcp_and_audio_switching_order.js were frequently crashing at the same point (on pjmedia when writing RTP).
This was solved by adding a z.sleep(1000) before call.terminate(). It seems it is caused by call termination being done too soon after reinvite.
We should check if this problem existed before (it might be a problem we added with the new multiple_media implementation).

-------------------------
write tests for:
  - removal of media
      INVITE: [{type: 'mcrp'},{type: 'audio'}]
      200 OK: [{type: 'audio'}]

-------------------------
if 'media: []' or 'media: null' it means there is no media, so do not generate a body (content-length: 0)

-------------------------
create a sample script with automatic reply for INFO, OPTIONS etc.

-------------------------
review processing of SUBSCRIBE (SUBSCRIBE is a dialog-creating method, so we should be able to keep the subscription object and be able to send requests (INFO) for it.

-------------------------
set proper call to PJW_LOCK/PJW_UNLOCK in on_dtmf and on_inband_dtmf

-------------------------
if digit buffers have no more space generate an error for the channel so that it doesn't get unnoticed.

-------------------------
update to use invite session's pools (https://docs.pjsip.org/en/latest/api/generated/pjsip/group/group__PJSIP__INV.html)

-------------------------
Need to add REFER (blind and consultative) samples.

-------------------------
Consider allowing to specify media in a simplified way like this:
  "media": ["audio", "mrcp"]
So, the items can be strings and they can be individually expanded to their default values:
  "media": [{"type": "audio"}, {"type": "mrcp"}]
